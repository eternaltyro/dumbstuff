Dumb Scripts
============

A repository of scripts to do everyday tasks and some advanced tasks.. I would be very VERRRY careful using these for anything serious. You've been warned.

List of scripts here:
---------------------

+ Ubuntu_dl Script to download the latest nightly build of an Ubuntu distro
+ aws_vpn_linux_cgw.sh Script to set up a Linux instance as a Customer Gateway for Amazon AWS VPN 
+ build_alljoyn.sh A desperate attempt to prepare RaspberryPi for compiling AllJoyn source
+ firewall.rules Simple IPtables Firewall Rules
+ harden.sh Attempt to scritify simple system hardening.
+ installstuff.sh Script to prep new personal systems
+ ...

### TO - ADD
